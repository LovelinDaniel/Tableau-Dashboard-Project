Project Overview: 
This project delivers an interactive Tableau dashboard that enables users to compare sales performance across two user-selected regions. By providing real-time insights into sales, profit, and order quantities, the dashboard empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and optimize regional performance.
Tools & Technology:
•	Tableau – for visualization and interactive dashboards
•	Parameters & Hierarchies – for dynamic region selection and multi-level analysis
•	Calculated Fields – to compute comparative metrics such as sales growth, profit margin, and order volume
Process & Methodology:
•	Data Preparation: Cleaned and structured sales dataset to include key metrics: sales, profit, and order quantity.
•	Parameters & Hierarchies: Built dynamic parameters allowing users to select any two regions for comparison.
•	Created hierarchical views: Region → State → City for multi-level insights.
•	Calculated Fields: Developed metrics to compare performance between regions:
o	Sales difference & growth percentage
o	Profit comparison & margin analysis
o	Order quantity comparison
•	Dashboard Design: Designed an interactive dashboard with filters, tooltips, and visual cues for intuitive exploration.
•	Enabled real-time analysis of regional performance trends.

Regional KPI Comparison
KPI	Region A	Region B	Observation
Total Sales	$X	$Y	Identifies the higher revenue region
Total Profit	$X	$Y	Highlights profitability differences
Profit Margin (%)	X%	Y%	Measures operational efficiency
Total Orders	X	Y	Compares demand volume
Average Order Value	$X	$Y	Shows customer purchasing behavior

Insights & Analysis:
•	Identified high-performing and underperforming regions in terms of sales and profit.
•	Highlighted regions with high order volumes but lower profit margins, signaling areas for operational improvement.
•	Enabled trend analysis over time to forecast regional growth opportunities.
•	Multi-level analysis revealed city-level outliers significantly impacting regional performance.
Key Findings:
•	Region A: Higher sales but lower profit margins → opportunities to optimize pricing and cost strategy.
•	Region B: Fewer orders but higher profitability → indicates premium or high-value sales.
•	City-level insights enabled targeted marketing and operational strategies.
•	The interactive dashboard allowed users to explore trends dynamically and make strategic, data-driven decisions.
Outcome:
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of regional sales performance, enabling business leaders to:
•	Identify revenue and profit trends across regions
•	Optimize sales strategies and resource allocation
•	Improve operational efficiency and profitability
